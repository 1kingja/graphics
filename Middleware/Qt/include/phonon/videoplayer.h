 * \short Playback class for simple tasks.
 *
 * With %VideoPlayer you can get results quickly and easily. You can do the standard
 * playback tasks like play, pause and stop, but also set a playback volume and
 * seek (there's no guarantee that the seek will work, though).
 *
 * Keep in mind that when the %VideoPlayer instance is deleted the playback will
 * stop.
 *
 * A play and forget code example:
 * \code
 * VideoPlayer *player = new VideoPlayer(parentWidget);
 * connect(player, SIGNAL(finished()), player, SLOT(deleteLater()));
 * player->play(url);
 * \endcode

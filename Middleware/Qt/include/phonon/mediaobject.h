    /** \class MediaObject mediaobject.h Phonon/MediaObject
     * \short Interface for media playback of a given URL.
     *
     * This class is the most important class in %Phonon. Use it to open a media
     * file at an arbitrary location, a CD or DVD or to stream media data from
     * the application to the backend.
     *
     * This class controls the state (play, pause, stop, seek)
     * and you can use it to get a lot of information about the media data.
     *
     * Notice that most functions of this class are asynchronous.
     * That means if you call play() the object only starts playing when the
     * stateChanged() signal tells you that the object changed into PlayingState.
     * The states you can expect are documented for those methods.
     *
     * A common usage example is the following:
     * \code
     * media = new MediaObject(this);
     * connect(media, SIGNAL(finished()), SLOT(slotFinished());
     * media->setCurrentSource("/home/username/music/filename.ogg");
     * media->play();
     * \endcode
     *
     * If you want to play more than one media file (one after another) you can
     * either tell MediaObject about all those files
     * \code
     * media->setCurrentSource(":/sounds/startsound.ogg");
     * media->enqueue("/home/username/music/song.mp3");
     * media->enqueue(":/sounds/endsound.ogg");
     * \endcode
     * or provide the next file just in time:
     * \code
     *   media->setCurrentSource(":/sounds/startsound.ogg");
     *   connect(media, SIGNAL(aboutToFinish()), SLOT(enqueueNextSource()));
     * }
     *
     * void enqueueNextSource()
     * {
     *   media->enqueue("/home/username/music/song.mp3");
     * }
     * \endcode
